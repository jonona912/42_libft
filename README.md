## 💡 About the project

> _Libft is an individual project focused on developing a custom C library by reimplementing a selection of standard C functions and additional utilities. This project establishes a foundation for future work by emphasizing efficient, reusable code and deepening understanding of core programming concepts essential for subsequent projects at 42._

## 🛠️ Usage
### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, go to the library path and run:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "libft.h"
```
