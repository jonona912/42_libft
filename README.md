## üí° About the project

> _This project is about coding a C library. It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon._

	Libft is an individual project that requires you to recode a set of standard C library functions, as well as additional utility functions, to build your own library. It serves as a foundation for future projects, teaching you how to write efficient, reusable code.

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/jonona912/42_libft/blob/main/libft_subject.pdf).
## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, go to the library path and run:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "libft.h"
```
